# My-Life-Project

A website that I built in order to help people get a next-gen console. More to come... much much more.

Using Node and Express to serve the files to build my front-end React app, My Life Project.

Still working with the server to get users to sign up and store their information.

To be continued...

Get your next-gen console with me!
